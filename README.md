                Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project involved determining requirements and designing a driver course system. The client was a small business owner who wanted to increase the initial passing rate of student drivers. The system they wanted designed is one built on a cloud based platform that was easily accessible by different devices. The system allowed students to access their online courses, reserve in-car driving lessons, and keep up with their progress.

                What did you do particularly well?
I believbe I detemermined the requirements for the system well and had a good grasp on the client's needs and expectations. 

                If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part of my work to revise, it would be the umls class diagram. If I were to redo it, I would also include methods to include clarity on how the object interfaced with each other. 

                How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I determined the user's needs through an interview transcript and personal experience with online courses. It is important to consider user needs because they will be interacting with the system and paying to use the system. If the user does not have a good experience they are not likely to use or refer DriverPass.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My approach to designing the software was first to determine requirements in the business design document, and then building use cases and functional and behavioral diagrams. Then continuing to iterate until there was a good enough understanding to implement the design.
